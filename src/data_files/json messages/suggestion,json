When you suggest a game, it will first look up if there could be any game already suggested with a similar name to potentially avoid duplicates (it does its best but it's not the most robust thing in the world, so please take a look at the list yourself before suggesting if you can).\nIf no duplicates are found (or you tell the bot you are sure this is a new game) then a suggestion will be added. \nIf you want to suggest a game that is already in the list, you can vote it instead, which will just add a star to it. When later Michael fetches the list of suggestions he will be able to see which games have the most votes.\n",
